# 📈 Algorithmic Trading Bot - ProjectAT

## Project Description
This repository documents my journey in building an automated algorithmic trading system from scratch. As a Mathematics and Data Science student, the primary goal of this project is to **consolidate my knowledge** in programming, data analysis, and financial markets.

Currently, the project is in the **infrastructure phase**: building a robust pipeline for data acquisition, cleaning, and backtesting. The specific trading strategies will be developed and selected based on rigorous statistical analysis of historical data.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Financial Data:** Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`)
* **Tools:** Git, Jupyter Notebooks

## 🔭 Roadmap & Learning Goals
The development is structured in the following stages:
1.  **Data Pipeline:** Automated downloading and cleaning of financial time-series.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding market volatility and correlations.
3.  **Backtesting Engine:** Building a simulator to test hypotheses without risking capital.
4.  **Strategy Development:** Exploring concepts like Momentum, Mean Reversion, or Machine Learning models based on findings.

## 📚 References
This project's roadmap and implementation steps are largely based on the methodology presented in:
* **"Trading algorítmico con Python"** by **Isaac Trullàs**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/src`: Source code for the bot's core logic.
* `/notebooks`: Experiments and statistical tests.
* `/data`: Local storage for datasets (ignored by version control).
